          <b>Abeliophyllum (White Forsythia, or Korean Abelialeaf)</b> is a
          monotypic genus of flowering plants in the olive family, Oleaceae. It
          consists of one species, Abeliophyllum distichum Nakai, endemic to
          Korea, where it is endangered in the wild, occurring at only seven
          sites. It is related to Forsythia, but differs in having white, not
          yellow, flowers.<br /><br />
          It is a deciduous shrub growing to 1 to 2 m tall. The leaves are
          opposite, simple, 6 to 10 cm long and 3 to 4.5 cm wide, pubescent both
          above and below. The flowers are produced in early spring before the
          new leaves appear; they are white and fragrant, about 1 cm long, with
          a four-lobed corolla. The fruit is a round, winged samara 2 to 3 cm
          diameter. <br /><br />It is cultivated as an ornamental plant in
          Europe and North America.
